Imagine you’re guessing how many candies are in a jar. 
If one friend guesses, their answer might be way off (high variance). 
But if you ask a group of friends and take the average of their guesses, the result will usually be much closer to the actual number. 
This is how a random forest works—it combines many “wild guesses” (trees with high variance) 
to make a much better overall guess (lower variance).

However, if there’s a lot of useless information (like asking about the jar’s color when it doesn’t matter),
the random forest can still mess up (overfitting) because it gets distracted by unimportant details.

You throw a bunch of darts, and there are two things that can happen:

Bias: If all your darts land in one spot, but it’s far from the center of the target,
it means you are missing the target consistently in the same way. 
This is like having a bias—you're making a mistake in the same direction every time. 
You might be aiming a little wrong, and so all your throws are off in the same way.

Variance: If your darts are landing all over the place—some close to the center, 
some far away—it means you’re not consistent. 
The throws are all over the place, and there’s a lot of variance. 
You’re not making the same mistake every time, but the throws are still random.

In machine learning, we want to find a good balance:

High bias means we are making the same mistake consistently (like always missing the target in the same way).
High variance means the results are all over the place, and we don’t have a stable pattern.
The goal is to avoid both extremes: we don’t want to always make the same mistake (high bias), 
and we don’t want to be super unpredictable (high variance). 
We want our model to be good and consistent, like hitting the target in a way that’s close to the center most of the time.
