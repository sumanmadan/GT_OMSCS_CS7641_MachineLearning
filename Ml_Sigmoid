Imagine you’re trying to decide if you want to go outside based on how cloudy it is. 
If the sky is super clear, you’re really excited to go outside, but if it’s really cloudy, you just want to stay inside.

Now, Sigmoid works like a special scale to decide how much you want to go outside, based on how cloudy the sky is.

If the sky is clear (a really high number), Sigmoid turns that into a value close to 1, meaning “Yes, go outside!”
If the sky is super cloudy (a really low number), Sigmoid turns that into a value close to 0, meaning “No, stay inside.”
In between, if the sky is a little cloudy or a little clear, Sigmoid will give you a number somewhere in between 0 and 1, 
helping you decide how much you want to go outside. 
It helps to make things less extreme and more gradual!
