To understand why bagging reduces variance at the cost of bias, let’s break it down simply:

Variance means how much a model’s predictions change if we train it on different datasets.

Models like decision trees can be very sensitive (high variance) because small changes in the data can lead to very different results.
Bagging creates multiple trees with different subsets of the data and combines their results (like voting). This averaging smooths out the differences, reducing variance.
Bias means how far the model’s predictions are from the true values on average.

By averaging many models, bagging simplifies the overall prediction slightly, which can introduce a small error (bias).
For example, if each tree slightly overfits (follows the data too closely), averaging them might make the final result less overfitted but also less perfect.
Short Answer for a Kid:
Bagging is like asking a group of friends for their guesses and averaging them. It makes the guesses more stable (reduces variance), but because it blends their answers, 
it might not be perfectly right every time (adds a little bias).

Imagine three friends looking at a messy handwriting note.

Friend 1 over-focuses on one part of the note and says, "It must say 'cat.'"
Friend 2 over-focuses on another part and says, "No, it says 'car.'"
Friend 3 has their own guess: "I think it says 'cut.'"
Each friend overfits to different parts of the note. But when they vote, the majority agrees on "cat," which is closest to the correct answer. 
Bagging works like this—it balances out overfitting mistakes by combining guesses.
