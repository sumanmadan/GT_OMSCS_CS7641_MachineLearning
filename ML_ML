Machine Learning (ML):
ML is a branch of artificial intelligence where algorithms learn from data to 
make predictions or decisions without explicit programming.

Supervised Learning (SL)
Definition: Learning from labeled data to make predictions.
Goal: Predict output (labels) for new, unseen data.
Types:
Regression (predict continuous values):
Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression
Classification (categorize into classes):
Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest
Algorithms/Models:

Linear Regression: Predict continuous values
Logistic Regression: Predict binary outcomes (e.g., spam or not)
SVM: Binary classification with optimal hyperplane
KNN: Classifies based on nearest data points
Decision Trees: Classification/regression with decision rules
Random Forest: Ensemble of decision trees

Unsupervised Learning (USL)
Definition: Learning from unlabeled data to find hidden patterns.
Goal: Discover structures or groupings in data without specific labels.
Types:

Clustering (group similar data points):
K-means, Hierarchical Clustering, DBSCAN
Dimensionality Reduction (reduce features):
PCA (Principal Component Analysis), t-SNE
Algorithms/Models:

K-means: Groups data into k clusters
DBSCAN: Density-based clustering
PCA: Reduces data dimensions, preserving variance
t-SNE: Reduces dimensions for visualization
