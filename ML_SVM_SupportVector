Imagine you’re playing a game of separating red and blue dots on a piece of paper. 
You can draw a straight line to separate them, but what if the dots are messy and not easy to separate?

This is where SVMs (Support Vector Machines) come in!

They try to find the best line (hyperplane) that separates the two groups of dots as much as possible.
Some dots are really close to the dividing line and are tricky to separate—these dots are called support vectors. They help decide the position of the best line.
If the dots are messy, SVMs can move the problem into a higher-dimensional space (like imagining the dots in 3D instead of flat 2D) to find a better way to separate them.
SVMs are smart because they avoid getting stuck in mistakes (local minima) by using math (called optimization with kernel functions) to find the best answer efficiently.
