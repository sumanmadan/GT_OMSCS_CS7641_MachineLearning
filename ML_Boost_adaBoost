Imagine you’re trying to build a team to play soccer. Some of your teammates aren’t great at every position, 
but each one is good at a specific area of the game. Boosting is like combining all their strengths together to make one super soccer team.

Weak Learners: These are like players who are good at certain things but not everything.
Strong Learner: When you work as a team, all their skills combine to create something powerful.
AdaBoost is one example of this teamwork idea. It learns from mistakes, improves step-by-step, 
and builds a better team (stronger decision-making) without needing too much planning or special rules.

Boosting Algorithm Explained Simply
Imagine you’re learning to solve a puzzle. Each time you make a mistake, you focus on the mistake and try to do better next time.

First, you solve part of the puzzle (your first attempt).
Then, you learn from what you missed and solve the next part better.
You keep learning from mistakes until you finish the puzzle well.
Boosting works the same way:

It creates many small, weak learners (mistakes or simple guesses).
Each one learns from the errors of the previous ones.
Together, they build a stronger, better final decision.
