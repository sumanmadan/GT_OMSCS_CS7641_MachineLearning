Imagine you're jumping on a trampoline. When you jump up, the trampoline pushes you back down, 
but if you're not jumping at all (just standing still), the trampoline doesn't push you down at allâ€”it stays flat.

Now, think of ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) like that trampoline, but for numbers. 
It helps computers understand how much "jump" to give. If the number is positive,
ReLU lets it keep going, just like how the trampoline would push you up when you jump. If the number is negative or zero,
ReLU just keeps it at zero, kind of like how the trampoline does nothing when you're standing still.

In short: ReLU lets good things (positive numbers) go up and stops bad things (negative numbers) from going anywhere.
